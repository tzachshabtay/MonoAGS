<h1 id="ags-cheat-sheet">AGS Cheat Sheet</h1>

<p>This is a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; for people coming in from <code>AGS</code>. The &quot;cheat sheet&quot; is divided into 2 sections. The first section roughly demonstrates the language differences between AGS script and c#. The second section goes over the AGS scripting API (individual functions and properties) and compares them with AGS: it shows how to do the same in <code>MonoAGS</code>, or if something is missing, and also explaining some differences between the two, with brief highlights of things that don&#39;t exist in <code>AGS</code> but do exist in <code>MonoAGS</code>.</p>
<h1 id="general-scripting-differences">General Scripting Differences</h1>
<p>C# has a lot of similarities to AGS Script, but there are also many differences. In some sense, c# is simpler than AGS script (no pointers, no script headers, the order of the scripts doesn&#39;t matter), and in another sense it&#39;s more complicated (all functions need to be wrapped in classes/structs, and there are a lot more keywords).
Let&#39;s go over the main differences:</p>
<h2 id="writing-functions">Writing Functions</h2>
<p>In AGS, a common function signature might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>
function do_something(int param)
{
    // contents of function go here
}
</code></pre><p>The equivalent in c# would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
void do_something(int param)
{
    // contents of function go here
}
</code></pre><p>The only difference here is that instead of <code>function</code> we wrote <code>void</code>. <code>void</code> is a keyword that means that the function doesn&#39;t return anything.
In c#, when you write a function, you need to declare what the function returns.</p>
<p>So, if the AGS function returns an int, like this:</p>
<pre><code>
function do_something(int param)
{
    return 5;
}
</code></pre><p>The c# equivalent function will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
int do_something(int param)
{
    return 5;
}
</code></pre><p>Another big difference is that in AGS we can write a function anywhere in the file. In c#, the functions need to be written inside either a class or a struct, and that needs to be wrapped inside a namespace.
A namespace is used to group multiple classes together, you shouldn&#39;t usually worry about this, when you add a new code file from the editor the namespace is automatically generated and written to the file.</p>
<p>A c# struct is identical to the AGS struct, and a c# class represents a reference type, which basically means it&#39;s an instance that you can carry around: this is basically the replacement to pointers in AGS.
It&#39;s not critical to understand this at first, as almost always you&#39;d want to use a class. If you want to dig deeper and understand when you&#39;d like to use a struct, this link is a good start: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/choosing-between-class-and-struct">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/choosing-between-class-and-struct</a></p>
<p>A single class can contain multiple functions, and is usually used to group functions which revolve around the same purpose.
So, in our example, we&#39;ll put the <code>do_something</code> function in a class like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
namespace MyGame
{
    class MyClass
    {
        int do_something(int param)
        {
            return 5;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><h2 id="returning-multiple-values-from-a-function">Returning multiple values from a function</h2>
<p>If you want to return multiple values from your function in AGS script, you&#39;d have to create a struct especially for that purpose, which complicates things. In c#, you can just use tuples for this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
(float x, float y) get_position()
{
    return (100, 200);
}
</code></pre><p>You can now call this function easily like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
(float x, float y) = get_position();
Debug.WriteLine($&quot;X = {x}, Y = {y}&quot;);
</code></pre><h2 id="variables--scope">Variables &amp; Scope</h2>
<p>Variables in c# are declared the same way as in AGS script, with the difference that, like functions, the variables need to reside inside the class/struct.</p>
<p>Variables can also declared inside a function, this would make their scope local to the function, meaning that the variable will not exist once the function completes.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
namespace MyGame
{
    class MyClass
    {
        string var1;
        string var2 = &quot;Hello&quot;;

        int do_something(int param)
        {
            string var3 = &quot;Hi&quot;;

            var1 = &quot;aaa&quot;;
            var2 = &quot;bbb&quot;;
            var3 = &quot;ccc&quot;;

            return 5;
        }

        int do_something2()
        {
            var1 = &quot;aaa&quot;;
            var2 = &quot;bbb&quot;;
            var3 = &quot;ccc&quot;; //THIS DOES NOT COMPILE, var3 does not exist!
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>In the example above, <code>var1</code> and <code>var2</code> are class variables, so they can be used anywhere within the class. <code>var3</code> however, is local to the <code>do_something</code> function, so it cannot be accessed from the <code>do_something2</code> function.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-functions--variables">Exporting functions &amp; variables</h2>
<p>In AGS script, in order to be able to access a function from different script, you need to add an import to it in your exporting script header, and in order to export a variable you need to add an <code>export</code> to it and that <code>export</code> must reside in the end of the file.</p>
<p>In c#, there is no script header file: both functions and variables can be exported simply by prefixing them with the keyword <code>public</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
public string var1;

public int do_something()
{
    return 5;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="static-vs-instance">Static vs instance</h2>
<p>Another big difference that needs to be understood, is the different between static functions/variables to instance functions/variables. In AGS, functions and variables that are declared inside a struct are instance functions/variables, but all other functions and variables that you code are static.</p>
<p>In c#, however, all functions/variables are instance by default, unless you explicitly make them static. The difference is that instance functions/variables are associated with instances that are generated from the class (which can be looked at like a blueprint for creating instances), while static variables belong to the class itself.</p>
<p>If I have a <code>Dog</code> class to represent a dog, and a <code>health</code> variable that gives a number between 0-100 to say how healthy the dog is, then <code>health</code> should be an instance variable: if I create 3 different dogs, they should have 3 different <code>health</code> states.
If, on the other hand, I have a <code>Utilities</code> class with random scripts, and among them I have a <code>sum_two_numbers</code> function, that function makes sense as a static function, there is no point in having 2 (or more) &quot;Utilities&quot;.</p>
<p>In c#, to have a function (or variable) static, you prefix it with the keyword <code>static</code>.</p>
<p>So the 2 examples from above would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
namespace MyGame
{
    class Dog
    {
        public int Health;
    }

    class Utitilies
    {
        public static int sum_two_numbers(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><h2 id="importing-functions--variables">Importing functions &amp; variables</h2>
<p>In AGS, to import functions/variables you need to add an import for them in the script header.
In c#, assuming both files are using the same namespace, you can call them without adding anything specific.</p>
<p>How you call the functions/variables in c# depends if they are static or instance functions/variables.
For static functions/variables you need to prefix the class name and a dot before the function/variable.
For instance functions/variables you need to create a new instance of your class using the <code>new</code> keyword, assign that to a variable, and then you can call that instance&#39;s functions/variables by prefixing it with the variable name and a dot.</p>
<p>As an example, let&#39;s use or <code>Dog</code> and <code>Utilities</code> classes from the previous example in a different file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
namespace MyGame
{
    class MyClass
    {
        Dog dog1 = new Dog();
        Dog dog2 = new Dog();

        void init()
        {
            dog1.Health = 10;
            dog2.Health = 20;

            int combined_health = get_dogs_combined_health();
            Debug.WriteLine($&quot;The combined health of both dogs is: {combined_health}&quot;);
        }

        int get_dogs_combined_health()
        {
            return Utilities.sum_two_numbers(dog1.Health, dog2.Health);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Sometimes we want to import functions/variables from another namespace which is not our own.
For example, the <code>Debug.WriteLine</code> we used above (that writes a message to our debug console) is part of the <code>System.Diagnostics</code> namespace, as that is part of the c# standard library. The standard library is a library of common useful functions that is bundled with every c# application (and it has a lot of useful stuff in there). Because it&#39;s in a different namespace than ours, we need to explicitly import that namespace, and we do that with the <code>using</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace MyGame
{
    class MyClass
    {
        void write_hello()
        {
            Debug.WriteLine(&quot;Hello!&quot;);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Note that if you&#39;re using an IDE like Visual Studio to write your code, and you forgot putting the <code>using</code> section, a lot of times Visual Studio can add this automatically for you: you&#39;ll see a squigly line under your usage of a missing library (<code>Debug.WriteLine</code> in this scenario) and a lightbulb icon which, when clicked on, will give you the option to automatically add the missing <code>using</code> clause.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to import functions/variables from an external library: in that case we&#39;ll want to add a reference to that library before we can add <code>using</code> clauses for its namespaces.
For example, we might want to add a library that will allow us to vibrate the mobile phone (if the game is played on a mobile phone). We can search for an available package directly from the IDE. From Visual Studio, under your project node in the solution explorer, there&#39;s a &quot;Packages&quot; node, right click it and select &quot;add package&quot;. This will open a window in which you can search and install packages. If you search for &quot;vibrate&quot;, for example, you&#39;ll see &quot;Vibrate Plugin for Xamarin and Windows&quot; which you can then install by clicking &quot;Add Package&quot;.
Once you have the package installed, you can use its namespaces using the same <code>using</code> keyword we saw before (and you should read that package documentation to understand how to use it).</p>
<h2 id="scripts">Scripts</h2>
<p>In AGS, you have a global script, room scripts, and additional scripts you can create on will. In c# there&#39;s no global script, and you are free to organize the scripts as you want them to be.
The order of the scripts (unlike AGS) does not matter.
There are no &quot;special functions&quot; that you can put in your script (like <code>game_start</code>) that are magically called, you have to call it yourself.</p>
<h2 id="data-types-and-operators">Data types and operators</h2>
<p>All AGS data types and operators exist in c# with the same syntax, and used the same way.
c# has additional data types and operators which do not exist in AGS.</p>
<p>You can see all data types here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/types-and-variables">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/types-and-variables</a></p>
<p>You can see all operators here: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6a71f45d(v=vs.120).aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6a71f45d(v=vs.120).aspx</a></p>
<p>Additionally, c# has the keyword <code>var</code> which can be used when declaring the variable is it is clear what data type it has.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
var x = &quot;hello&quot;; //x is a string, it&#39;s clear from how x is initialized, so we can use var instead of string when declaring the variable (if we want).
</code></pre><h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>
<p>The c# syntax for arrays is slightly different from the AGS syntax for dynamic arrays, in that you put the brackets next to the type and not next to the variable name:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
int[] characterHealth = new int[50];

</code></pre><p>Also, in c# you have lists, which is like an array only without a size limit, so you can add and remove items from the list:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
List&lt;int&gt; characterHealth = new List&lt;int&gt;();

characterHealth.Add(5);
characterHealth.Add(6);
characterHealth.Add(7);

Debug.WriteLine(characterHealth[0]); //5
Debug.WriteLine(characterHealth[1]); //6
Debug.WriteLine(characterHealth[2]); //7

characterHealth.RemoveAt(1);
Debug.WriteLine(characterHealth[0]); //5
Debug.WriteLine(characterHealth[1]); //7
</code></pre><h2 id="conditionals-and-loops">Conditionals and Loops</h2>
<p>The syntax for <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code> and <code>switch</code> in c# is identical to the syntax in AGS.</p>
<p>C# also had additional constructs for conditionals and loops: most notably the <code>?</code> operator can be used in some scenarios instead of <code>if</code>, and the <code>foreach</code> keyword can be used in some scenarios instead of <code>while</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
//using an if:
string getVisibleWord()
{
    if (visible) return &quot;visible&quot;;
    else return &quot;invisible&quot;;
}

//using &#39;?&#39;
string getVisibleWord()
{
    return visible ? &quot;visible&quot; : &quot;invisible&quot;;
}

//using while
int getSum(int[] numbers)
{
    int sum = 0;
    int index = 0;
    while (index &lt; numbers.Length)
    {
        sum += numbers[index];
        index++;
    }
    return sum;
}

//using foreach
int getSum(int[] numbers)
{
    int sum = 0;
    foreach (int number in numbers)
    {
        sum += number;
    }
    return sum;
}
</code></pre><p>Also, c# has a wonderful querying language for collections, called LINQ, which can be used to make a lot of tasks more simpler. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
//without LINQ
int getSumOfNumbersBiggerThan10(int[] numbers)
{
    int sum = 0;
    foreach (int number in numbers)
    {
        if (number &gt; 10) sum += number;
    }
    return sum
}

//with LINQ
int getSumOfNumbersBiggerThan10(int[] numbers)
{
    return numbers.Where(number =&gt; number &gt; 10).Sum();
}
</code></pre><p>You can read more on LINQ here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/getting-started-with-linq">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/getting-started-with-linq</a></p>
<h2 id="string-formatting">String Formatting</h2>
<p>c# has a <code>string.Format</code> function which is similar to the <code>String.Format</code> function in AGS.
c# also has support for string interpolation, though, which usually gives a better experience.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go over the different of <code>string.Format</code> first:</p>
<p>In AGS script:</p>
<pre><code>
String posString = String.Format(&quot;The position is: %d,%d&quot;, x, y);
</code></pre><p>In c#:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
string posString = string.Format(&quot;The position is: {0},{1}&quot;, x, y);
</code></pre><p>The main different is that in AGS script you need to specify the type of the variables, where you don&#39;t have to do that in c#, but in c# you have to specify the location of the parameter in the string.</p>
<p>AGS also has the <code>%0Xd</code> and <code>%.Xf</code> special formatting codes for zero padding and showing decimal places. c# also has special formatting codes for a lot more scenarios. So, for example, for padding to 5 zeroes and showing 3 decimal places, we can rewrite our previous formatting like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
string posString = string.Format(&quot;The position is: {0:00000.###},{1:00000.###}&quot;, x, y);
</code></pre><p>You can read about all the special formatting codes here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/formatting-types">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/formatting-types</a></p>
<p>AGS also uses the left bracket as a special code for a new line, in c# you can use <code>Environment.NewLine</code> instead.</p>
<h3 id="string-interpolation">String Interpolation</h3>
<p>String interpolation is a newer type of formatting which allows placing the parameters directly in the string. For creating an interpolated string, you should prefix the string with <code>$</code>, and then can directly put the parameters inside <code>{}</code>.
So we can rewrite our previous example like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
string posString = $&quot;The position is: {x:00000.###},{y::00000.###}&quot;;
</code></pre><p>You can read more about interpolated strings here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interpolated-strings">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interpolated-strings</a></p>
<h2 id="constants-compilation-flags">Constants (Compilation Flags)</h2>
<p>What in AGS script is called &quot;constants&quot; is actually 2 separate things in c#: constants and compilation flags. In c# constants are variables that cannot be changed ever:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
const int x = 5;
x = 6; //This is illegal -&gt; will not compile
</code></pre><p>So, the AGS constant <code>AGS_MAX_INV_ITEMS</code> would have been defined as a constant in c# as well (though MonoAGS doesn&#39;t have all of the limit constants in AGS, there are no limits in MonoAGS).</p>
<p>On the contrary, all of the AGS constants that might or might not be defined, those are compilation flags. The AGS directive <code>#ifdef</code> has an equivalent <code>#if</code> directive in c# and <code>#ifndef</code> equivalent is <code>#if !</code>.
The <code>DEBUG</code> compilation flag that exists in AGS also exists in c#, so you can use it to do things only when debugging:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
#if DEBUG

//do something debug specific here.

#endif
</code></pre><p>All of the other AGS compilation flags are AGS specific and have no equivalents in MonoAGS.
Except for <code>#if</code>, c# has more directives which you can see here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/</a></p>
<h2 id="extender-functions">Extender functions</h2>
<p>The c# equivalent to AGS extender functions is extension methods (note that in c# a function is called a method usually, but it means the same thing).</p>
<p>The syntax is similar, with the exception that in c# you need to mark your method static and the class should also be marked as static (a static class is a class for which all the functions within are also static).</p>
<p>So, in AGS you would write:</p>
<pre><code>
function Scream(this Character*)
{
    this.Say(&quot;AAAAARRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!&quot;);
}
</code></pre><p>In c# you would write:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">
public static class CharacterExtensions
{
    public static void Scream(this ICharacter character)
    {
        character.Say(&quot;AAAAARRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre><h2 id="noloopcheck">noloopcheck</h2>
<p><code>noloopcheck</code> is something that&#39;s AGS specific and has no equivalent in c#. Or rather, the loop checks are AGS specific, you can think of all loops in c# as <code>noloopcheck</code>.</p>
<h2 id="asyncawait">async/await</h2>
<p><code>async/await</code> is a c# specific mechanism for asynchronous programming which doesn&#39;t have an equivalent in AGS.
As it&#39;s an important part of programming your game, there&#39;s a specific article devoted to <code>async/await</code>, which you can find <a href="async.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="api-comparisons">API Comparisons</h1>
<p>This section goes over each API provided by AGS (based on the AGS manual), and compares against the MonoAGS API. Items marked with <code>?</code> are items that currently don&#39;t have an equivalent in <code>MonoAGS</code>.</p>
<h2 id="audiochannel">AudioChannel</h2>
<p>The equivalent in <code>MonoAGS</code> would be <code>ISound</code>. Both are returned when you&#39;re playing an audio clip. The difference between AGS channel and MonoAGS sound is that a sound relates to the specific sound you&#39;re playing, it &quot;dies&quot; when you finished playing the sound. The channel however lives on throughout the game and can play other sounds in the future, so you can&#39;t always trust it&#39;s playing the sound you requested.</p>

<p>Missing in AGS but exists in MonoAGS: create and change dialogs at run-time, customize appearances of everything dialog related, asynchronously wait for a dialog to complete, automatic grey-out (or any desired rendering) for already selected options, show/hide dialog options when speaking, run a specific dialog option on demand, enable/disable specific dialog actions.</p>

<p>Missing in AGS but exists in MonoAGS: The whole process for custom dialog rendering is completely different (see notes on <code>DialogToRender</code>).</p>
<h2 id="drawingsurface">DrawingSurface</h2>
<p>Currently nothing built in that&#39;s equivalent for this, but one could directly implement <code>IImageRenderer</code>, assign it to its object with <code>obj.CustomRenderer = myRenderer</code> and use OpenGL in that renderer implementation to do everything desired.</p>
<h2 id="dynamicsprite">DynamicSprite</h2>
<p>The concept of dynamic sprite is not really needed in MonoAGS, as everything is dynamic by default, so you can create objects, characters, animations, etc, all in run-time. So in this section, equivalent behaviors might be found on one or more levels: bitmaps, images (container above bitmap which also adds texture information), sprites (container above image which adds abilities for run-time transforms) and objects (which contain sprites as individual animation frames or a single image).</p>

<p>In AGS there&#39;s a separation between GUI and GUI controls, where GUI is a panel containing other controls.
In MonoAGS there&#39;s no distinction like this, as every control can contain other controls, however there is a &quot;Panel&quot; in MonoAGS which is a naked UI control without any other components added to it, which is probably the closest equivalent for AGS &quot;GUI&quot;.</p>
